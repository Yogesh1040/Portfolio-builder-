Starting the app locally
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

npm install
This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

npm start
Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
